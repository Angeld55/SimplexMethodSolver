# SimplexMethodSolver
Simple prototype for a solver for linear optimization problems.
The program only creates the simplex table, but does NOT give the solutions (TBI).

Tested with the examples from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B798UGUwaJJzRjd3dVhuYWd0WVE?fbclid=IwAR1XV-1FJ88e763UHRcUnFjaiwHlZCH1l23ZlKuNDRWA1yrJvL5cwKOz0m0&resourcekey=0-w3g230-jFSPqLtmAM521Ng)

See ExampleConfigFiles/task1.txt to see how to make the config file.
